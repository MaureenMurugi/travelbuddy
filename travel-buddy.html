        <h1>Who is this?</h1>
        <p>Surpise,my travel buddy is actually my family. We are a family of six and every time there is a holiday, we take the time
            to explore our country. It's always for a good bonding time, time to catch up and most of all have some fun. Our favorite
            time of the year is definitely christmas season, everyone is available, it is an off-time to our working parents.
        </p>
        <p>This is the A-team</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The one and only, Dad</li>
            <li>Her awesomeness, Mum</li>
            <li>Me, ofcourse</li>
            <li>Hype master, elder brother</li>
            <li>Dance master, twin sister</li>
            <li>Savage, twin brother</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You are probably wondering where we travel to. We tend to travel the country, counties wise , it is easier to track
            the places we have been and the places we still haven't visited. We normaally would take a week to extensively
            explore a certain place or county make memorable times and definitely try out new foods.
        </p>
        <p>Here is the list of the favorite places</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The South coast</li>
            <li>Lake Victoria</li>
